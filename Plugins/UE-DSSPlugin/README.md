# DSS Features

Dynamic servers system provides bunch of features and advantages such as:
```
1. Horizontal scalability
2. Easy to use (Plug and play)
3. Dynamic player spawning locations(Based on forward vector or predefined)
4. Time synchronization accross servers
5. Dungeon instantiation
6. Multi-regional servers
7. Full Blueprints support
8. Auto scale-in to save resource
9. JWT Authorization
10. per-Level players limit
```
# DSS Supported Servers
```
1. Windows x86_64
2. Linux x86_64
3. Linux ARM64
```
# DSS Supported Clients
```
1. Windows x86_64
2. Linux x86_64
3. Android
4. IOS 'Not tested!!'
```
# Connecting to DSS Server Node With Signing key(Not recommended)
Only on client you are responsible for the connection with DSS server, On Dedicated servers it is automated.
Since the token is generated locally (Not a good idea), if there is a time difference between client and server your token might be already expired. Thus you might get 401 Unauthorized. 

<h1 align="Center">
  <br>
    <img src="Images/Connect.png" alt="Connect" width="1000">
</h1>

```
1. Connection: Http://LoadBalancerIP:Port
2. PlayerName: Players character name
3. Signing key: Non Base64 Encoded signing Key should be used same as server
```
# Connecting to DSS Server Node With Token(Recommended)

If you have your own authorization server that generates JWT token make sure to sign the token using HS256 algorithm.
Include the following claims:

```
1. "role": "client"
2. "name": <"player character name">
3. "exp": <unix expiration timestamp>
```

Please refer to the following site to verify your token 
[JWTIO](https://jwt.io/)

# Delegates

DSS supports a bunch of delegates that helps you build your game easily

### OnTravel
Called after server respond to Travel

```
1. ServerIP: Virtual machine Ip where to connect
2. ServerPort: UE4 Server port
3. PlayerName: Character name that requested the travel
4. ServerConnectionID: Unique UE4 server ID could be used with servers communication
5. Other coordinates corrisponds to the spwaning location
```
### OnDisconnected
Called after UE4Server/Client disconnects from DSS Server

### OnServerTerminate
Called by DSS Server on UE4 Server to request server shutdown

### OnConnectionError
Called when connection attempt failed with Error message

### OnConnected
Called on Client and UE Server after connecting to DSS Server

```
1. ClientID: Unique client/server ID
2. ConnectionID: Unique connection ID
3. Timestamp: Time synchronization across all UE4 Servers
```

### ShowLoadingScreen
Called on Travel to show loading screen

# Travel Nodes
Travel node could be called from client side or from server side(with player character name)

<h1 align="Center">

```
1. MapName: MapName and full path of where to connect the player
2. IsDungeon: Self explanatory
3. InstanceID: Dungeon InstanceID to connect to in case IsDungeon is true
4. TravelOptions: where to spawn player (None,Coordinate,Tag )
5. Tag: Player start tag if Travel Options set tot Tag
6. Location: where to spawn the player if Coordinates TravelOptions selected
7. Yaw: Rotation around Z-Axis Coordinates TravelOptions selected
